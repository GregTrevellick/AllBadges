# Overview

Powered by [Read Me Synchronizer](https://github.com/GregTrevellick/ReadMeSynchronizer), this repo contains all the badges for all my repos (the ones I care about at least) all in one place.

This means I can:
  - manually test all my badges, both cosmetically & functionally, quickly from one place rather than the slow process of checking each repo individually
  - ensure badge consistency across many repos
  - easily spot problems (failing builds, failing tests, long running branches, etc) with any of my repos all in one place 

Bonus: the act of creating [Read Me Synchronizer](https://github.com/GregTrevellick/ReadMeSynchronizer) in the first place offered me the opportunity to create my first from-scratch typescript app, and learn along the way.
